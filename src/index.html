        <blockquote> <h1>Refactoring</h1>
           Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal
          structure without changing its external behavior.
          
          Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring")
          does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. Since each
          refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring,
          reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.
